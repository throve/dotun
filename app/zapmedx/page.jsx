            <h3>Introduction</h3>
               <p>{"ZapmedX is a fast-paced, growing healthcare platform, passionate about improving community health and wellness. ZapmedX aim to help eliminate stigmas and make it easier for people to access care and treatment for the conditions that impact their daily lives. Currently Operating in Lagos, Nigeria. ZapmedXâ€™s goal is to expand their reach beyond Nigeria to Africa, by providing people with accessible, convenient, and affordable healthcare services, where they can connect to pharmacies, lab tests, and doctors anywhere they are.

            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>{"In Lagos, Nigeria, and many other parts of Africa, accessing healthcare services can be a daunting task due to traffic congestion, long waiting times, and limited availability of medical resources. These challenges prevent people from receiving timely and adequate care, leading to worsened health conditions and a decreased quality of life. Furthermore, stigmas surrounding certain medical conditions can discourage individuals from seeking necessary treatment."}</p>
            <p>{"The existing healthcare infrastructure struggles to provide accessible, convenient, and affordable healthcare services to all residents, particularly those with mobility issues, busy schedules, or living in remote areas. There is a pressing need for a solution that simplifies and improves access to essential healthcare services, such as medication delivery, lab tests, and consultations with healthcare professionals."}</p>
            <p>{"ZapMedX aims to address these issues by creating a comprehensive platform that enables users to purchase medicines online, schedule home lab tests, and connect with doctors from the comfort of their homes. By doing so, ZapMedX seeks to enhance community health and wellness, eliminate healthcare stigmas, and ensure that everyone has access to the care and treatment they need to lead healthier lives."}</p>

            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>{"As a UI designer at ZapmedX, I was tasked with transforming the way Nigerians buy medicines and access consultations online. Building on the completed research and wireframes, I crafted a web application designed to offer a seamless user experience across three core features:"}</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Pharmacy This feature allows users to order medicines without hassle. I integrated a simple e-commerce flow to facilitate easy customer checkout, ensuring that users can quickly and efficiently purchase the medications they need.</li>
              <li>Diagnosis Here, users can book online tests and receive results from the comfort of their homes. The process is straightforward: users log in, browse the available tests, make a payment, and our experts visit their location to collect blood samples. Results are delivered within 24 hours, making the entire experience convenient and stress-free.</li>
              <li>Consult Users can easily connect with online doctors for consultations. This feature is designed to provide accessible and immediate medical advice, ensuring that users can get professional help whenever they need it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With these features, ZapmedX aims to revolutionise healthcare in Nigeria by making it more accessible, convenient, and efficient for everyone. </p>
